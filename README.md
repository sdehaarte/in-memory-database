# in-memory-database

# Overview
A fun little project that simulates a mini database!
This Python-based in memory key value store supports transactions just like how real databases ensure consistency during things like money transfer.

# Getting Started and How to Run
To get started, clone the repository in your terminal and run the code:

git clone https://github.com/sdehaarte/in-memory-database.git

cd in-memory-database

python3 -m unittest dbtest.py

# Brief Summary
Firstly, it's worth specifying the expected file name and outlining where the main logic should be written so students can organize their code. Secondly, the grading section could be more detailed right now it says "4 points for working code" that is a bit vague. It would help to break that down further maybe giving 1 point for each funtion with a explaination. Lastly, providing a few simple test cases would let students verfy that their code is working correctly before submitting, making grading more straightforward.
